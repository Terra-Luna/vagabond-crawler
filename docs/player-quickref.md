## Vagabond Crawler — Player Features

### Crawl Strip (top of screen)
- Shows all party members with HP, speed, and status
- Your portrait appears with current HP and movement remaining
- During **Heroes Turn**: you can move your token (speed is enforced)
- During **GM Turn**: the GM controls the action
- During **Combat**: movement tracks both normal speed and Rush

### Inventory
- **Right-click** an item in inventory for context menu (Light, Use Scroll, etc.)
- **Stacking**: Duplicate items auto-merge when added. Quantity shown as ×N badge.
- **Zero-slot items** (rations, scrolls, candles): 10 units per slot.
- **Spell Scrolls**: Right-click → "Use Scroll" to cast. No mana, no roll. Scroll is consumed.

### Light Sources
- Right-click a torch, lantern, candle, or sunrod → **Light** to activate
- Light sources burn in real-time during the crawl
- **Torches**: 1 hour, consumed when burned out
- **Lanterns**: require oil. 1 flask = 1 hour. Auto-refuel if you have more oil.
- **Candles**: 1 hour, 5ft radius (dim light)
- Extinguish by right-clicking → **Extinguish**. Remaining time is saved.

### Combat
- **Countdown dice** auto-roll at the start of each round (burning, poison, etc.)
- **Flanking**: If 2+ allies are adjacent to an enemy, it becomes Vulnerable
- **Movement**: Enforced during crawl and combat. Rush allows 2× speed in combat.

### Weapons & Attacks
- Click a weapon in the crawl strip action menu to attack
- **Target first**, then attack — the system checks Vulnerable, Favor/Hinder automatically
- Shift+click for Favor, Ctrl+click for Hinder on any roll
