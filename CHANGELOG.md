# Changelog

## v1.3.0

### New Features
- **Countdown Dice Auto-Roller** — Automatically rolls all countdown dice at the start of each combat round. Applies tick damage (burning, poison, etc.), shrinks dice on a roll of 1, and cleans up all dice when combat ends. Toggleable via world setting.
- **Inventory Stacking** — Dragging a duplicate item onto a character auto-merges it by incrementing quantity instead of creating a separate item. Inventory cards show a ×N quantity badge. The Slots display correctly accounts for stacked item quantities.
- **Lantern Fuel System** — Hooded and Bullseye lanterns now consume Oil (flask or basic) as fuel. Oil is only consumed when the lantern has no burn time remaining. Lanterns auto-refuel from inventory when oil runs out. Prefers Oil, flask over Oil, Basic.
- **Lantern Light Profiles** — Hooded Lantern: 90° directional cone (15ft bright / 30ft dim). Bullseye Lantern: 30ft bright / 60ft dim (full radius).
- **Light Source Splitting** — Lighting a stacked torch (qty > 1) splits off one torch as a separate item and lights it, leaving the stack intact.

### Bug Fixes
- **Item Sequencer Cone Patch** — Workaround for system item-sequencer not supporting cone animations (e.g. Breath Attack). Temporary patch until system adds native support.
- **Selfless Trigger Fix** (character-enhancer) — Selfless no longer triggers on attack cards, only on actual damage application messages.

## v1.2.0

### New Features
- **Pack Instincts / Pack Tactics** — NPC passive ability automation. When an NPC with Pack Instincts attacks a target, and an ally of that NPC is adjacent to the target, saves against the attack are Hindered. Works from both the crawl strip action menu and the actor sheet. Effect auto-cleans on turn change.
- **Terrain Difficulty** — Movement tracker now queries Scene Region "Modify Movement Cost" behaviors. Tokens moving through difficult terrain have their movement cost multiplied accordingly.
- **Enforce Combat Movement setting** — New world setting to toggle movement enforcement during combat independently from crawl movement enforcement.

### Improvements
- Movement distance is now computed once per token move instead of twice (deduplication).
- Terrain difficulty function accepts elevation as a parameter instead of performing a canvas token lookup.

## v1.1.0
- Alchemist Cookbook, NPC abilities (Magic Ward), flanking checker, combat strip enhancements.
